# FTPClient
A implementation of a bare bone FTP Client in GO.

This project stems from a Network class project in which we had to implement both a FTP client and server.
The original assignment was done in Python. This project would be a translation of that project using 
best practices (as much as possible) of GO. 

PS this is the first full fledged GO project that I have taken on.

``go run client.go <server ip> <port>``
